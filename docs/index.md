# **Welcome to the Ty modding wiki!**

This wiki contains modding documentation discovered by the Ty modding community, all sorted in one place

To get started with modding you can follow the the getting started guides here:<br />
[Ty 1 Getting Started](Ty1/index.md)<br />
[Ty 2 Getting Started](Ty2/index.md)

You can also navigate through the tabs or use the search bar to find what you need, the wiki is still a work in progress and more is being added as it gets discovered. If you have any questions about anything Ty modding related feel free to join the [Ty modding discord](https://discord.gg/g8kHTR42Cc)
