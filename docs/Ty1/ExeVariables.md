Would be nice to have the max golden cogs value but unfortunately haven't found them yet

## Requirements

| Variable | Variable Type | Hex Offset | Notes

| TE Machine Opal Requirement | int | 0x136904 | Requirement for all levels

### Charge Bite Requirement
>
>Charge bites work by having a separate hidden value that counts up for every opal that you collect, when trying to charge bite it checks if the requirement is less than the amount on the hidden counter. 
>After using a charge bite the hidden counter then gets minused by a set amount 
>
>The charge bite is a bit limited with how you can edit it because of it using a SAR ((bit)Shift Arithmetically Right) for dividing, 
>assuming the compiler for the game chose that as it's probably more optimised than using a divide opcode but its more limited with how many possible values it can divide by.
>
>The only possible values with the SAR are:
>
>| SAR Amount of Bits to Shift | Opal Requirement for Charge Bite
>| :-: | :-:
>| 0 | 3.125
>| 1 | 6.25
>| 2 | 12.5
>| 3 | 25
>| 4 | 50
>| 5 | 100
>
>Unfortunately SAR 6 isn't possible as it gives a value of 200 and the amount to minus and charge bite requirement values are both signed bytes which can only go up to 127.
>
>Values below 3 aren't really useful as they're not a whole number. Eg. if you used a SAR value of 2 the first charge bite shown on the UI would be at 13, as the requirement for charge bites needs to be less than the hidden counter, 
the second one would be 12 (total of 25 on the hidden counter), then the next would be 13 (total of 38), next would be 12 (total of 50), etc. The inconsistent amount would make the charge bite requirement and minusing value not match up since its a whole number

>| Variable | Variable Type | Hex Offset | Notes
>| - | :-: | - | -
>| Amount to Minus After Using Charge Bite | byte | 0x2829D | The amount that gets minused from the hidden counter for the charge bite
>| Charge Bite Requirement | byte | 0x29847 | If you have more than or equal to this amount on the hidden counter the game will let you charge bite
>| Charge Bite UI Opal Glow | byte (SAR) | 0xFB632 | The SAR operation that checks if you have enough on the hidden counter to show the brighter glow around the opal
>| Display Charge Bite Amount | byte (SAR) | 0xFB82E | Same as the glow one but shows the number for how many charge bites you have (See the value below to edit the count in the UI)
>| Max Charge Bites Displayed | int | 0xFC8A8 | By default this is 9, just documenting this even though couldn't ever really edit the requirement to make it have more than 9
>| Charge Bite Count | byte (SAR) | 0xFC8AE | This is the SAR that will count the charge bites for the count on the UI
>
>Last Value for the charge bite is related to the -tydev and -eadev launch options, these will set the amount of charge bites you have with them
>

## Picture Frames

Picture frames work quite differently from the other variables, their IDs get kept track of per level, and counted in a unique way. 
They all get counted from the address assigned in the LEA(load effective address) up until the address ebp -20, except for the bonus levels which work a bit differently, they instead count up until address ebp -136.

Increasing the amount of per level isn't fully possible but can be done with some trickery, decreasing the amount per level is much easier though, custom code or figuring out how to shuffle values around for each level without crashing would really help with being able to increase them

To edit which picture frames are assigned to which level just edit the ID at the offset, its even possible to have 2 levels have the same ID.

To **lower** the amount per level just go to the LEA offset and change the value to a lower variable pointer address, eg. if you wanted to change Rainbow cliffs to have 7 picture frames instead of 9 you would change the LEA from -52, to -44.
Also keep in mind which variables will be cut off from lowering the amount and reassign the IDs as needed.

**Increasing** the amount of IDs is a bit more complex and quite limited, it requires setting a level that is assigned IDs before another level (all the levels below are ordered) to have the same amount or less than the usual amount the next level would have.
eg. setting Rainbow cliffs LEA to -44 you can then set Two ups LEA up to -52 and use IDs at address -52 and -48 where Rainbow cliffs sets them for Two up as they have already been assigned a value and are no longer being used for Rainbow cliffs. 
This will then make Rainbow cliffs have 7 IDs and Two up have either 8 or 9.

But for something like Lyre Lyre which only has 5 and the level before it, snow worries, has 24, you would need to lower snow worries down to at least 5 IDs to then be able to add new unique IDs to Lyre to not have any overlap between the two levels

You could even go across multiple levels to increase the amount of ID, eg. could set Rainbow Cliffs and Two up to 6 frames, to then be able to increase the amount in Walk in the Park up to 9, just keep in mind you would need to set the ID at -44 with Two Ups addresses

To **disable** picture frames showing on the totals screen for a level just change the LEA to -16 (F0).

Below is offsets for each picture frame ID (all IDs are ints), the levels they are assigned to by default, and the pointer address for the local variable the IDs are located by default (reference for editing the LEA opcode)
